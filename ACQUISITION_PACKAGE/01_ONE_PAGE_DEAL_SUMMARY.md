## ‚úÖ WHY THIS BEATS BUILDING IT YOURSELF

### Build In-House Option:
```
Engineering cost: $300,000 (2 engineers √ó 6 months)
Opportunity cost: 6 months delay
Risk: I sell to competitor (a16z, Paradigm) and block you
Competition: Another .base launches while you're building
Total cost: $500K+ and 6 months lost
```

### Acquire from Me Option:
```
Cost: $500K upfront (same as building)
Timeline: Close in 30 days, launch in 60 days
Risk: None - code is proven and deployed
Competition: Blocked - I sign non-compete
Total cost: $500K + royalties (only if you succeed)
```

**You save 6 months AND eliminate competition risk.**

## üéØ WHY THIS IS SMART FOR ME

**I'm a builder, not a marketer.**

I built the tech. You have the distribution.

### What I Want:
- ‚úÖ $500K for 6 months of work (fair compensation)
- ‚úÖ Passive income if YOU succeed (aligned incentives)
- ‚úÖ No startup stress (you handle operations)
- ‚úÖ Clean exit (I move to next project)

### What I DON'T Want:
- ‚ùå To compete with Coinbase (impossible to win)
- ‚ùå To raise VC funding (too much work)
- ‚ùå To run a startup (not my skillset)
- ‚ùå To do marketing (I'm a dev)

**Your distribution makes us both rich. I couldn't do this alone.**
