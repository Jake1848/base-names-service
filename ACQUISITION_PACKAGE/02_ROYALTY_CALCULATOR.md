## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Risk/Reward is Asymmetric (in Coinbase's Favor)

**Coinbase's Risk:**
- $500K upfront (small for them)
- Royalties ONLY if they generate revenue

**Coinbase's Reward:**
- 92.5% of ALL revenue
- Even in aggressive case = $240M profit
- Minimal downside, massive upside

### 2. Your Incentives are Aligned

**You win when Coinbase wins:**
- If they market it well ‚Üí You get paid
- If they don't ‚Üí You get minimum guarantee
- If it explodes ‚Üí You get rich too
- No conflict of interest

### 3. The Math Works at ANY Scale

**Even if conservative:**
- They keep $55M
- You get $4.5M
- They still make 11,000% ROI

**If it goes viral:**
- They keep $240M
- You get $19.5M
- They still make 48,000% ROI

**You literally can't ask for too much.**

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE ROYALTY STRUCTURES

### Option A: Higher Upfront, Lower Royalty
```
Upfront: $750,000
Royalty: 5% (instead of 7.5%)

Year 5 Total (Moderate):
- Coinbase: $119,375,000
- You: $6,250,000 + $750K = $7M total

WHY: Lower ongoing burden for Coinbase
     You get more cash now
```

### Option B: Capped Royalty
```
Upfront: $500,000
Royalty: 7.5% capped at $10M total

After $10M paid:
- Royalty drops to 1% perpetual

WHY: Predictable max cost for Coinbase
     You still get tail revenue
```

### Option C: Time-Limited
```
Upfront: $500,000
Royalty: 10% for 5 years only

After Year 5:
- Royalties end, full ownership to Coinbase

WHY: Higher % for shorter term
     Clean expiration date
```

### Option D: Hybrid (RECOMMENDED)
```
Upfront: $500,000
Royalty: 7.5% uncapped

PLUS Minimum Guarantee:
- $50,000/year for first 5 years
- Total guaranteed: $750K over 5 years

WHY: Protects you if they don't market it
     Incentivizes them to actually launch
     Shows their commitment
```

## üìä MARKETPLACE REVENUE (BONUS)

### Additional Royalty: 2.5% of Marketplace Fees

**Assumptions:**
- Coinbase takes 2.5% marketplace fee
- 10% of domains trade annually
- Average sale price = 2x registration price

**Year 3 Example:**
```
200,000 active domains
√ó 10% trade annually = 20,000 sales
√ó $100 average price = $2,000,000 volume
√ó 2.5% marketplace fee = $50,000 to Coinbase
√ó 2.5% royalty to you = $1,250

Conservative marketplace royalty: ~$1K-5K/year
Moderate marketplace royalty: ~$10K-25K/year
Aggressive marketplace royalty: ~$50K-100K/year
```

**This is BONUS revenue on top of registration royalties.**

## üîç COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES

### If Coinbase Builds It Themselves:

**Cost:**
- 2 engineers @ $200K/year √ó 6 months = $200K
- Product manager @ $150K/year √ó 6 months = $75K
- Designer @ $120K/year √ó 3 months = $30K
- QA/Testing: $25K
- Security audit: $100K
- **Total: $430K**

**Timeline:** 6 months

**Risk:**
- You might sell to competitor (a16z, Paradigm)
- Competitor might launch .base first
- Opportunity cost of waiting

**Outcome:**
- Same contracts, same features
- But 6 months later
- And you're still competing

### If They Acquire from You:

**Cost:**
- Upfront: $500K
- Royalties: Only if successful

**Timeline:** 30 days to close, 60 days to launch

**Risk:**
- Minimal (code is proven)
- You sign non-compete

**Outcome:**
- Immediate ownership
- No competition
- 6 months time saved
- You help with transition

**ACQUISITION IS CHEAPER AND FASTER.**

---

## üí∞ WHAT YOU'RE REALLY BUYING

**Time:**
- 6 months development = $430K
- 6 months opportunity cost = Priceless

**Position:**
- First .base TLD = Market leadership
- No competitor .base = Monopoly

**De-Risked Code:**
- Already deployed and tested
- Already verified on BaseScan
- Already has users (proof of concept)

**Peace of Mind:**
- I won't compete (non-compete)
- I won't sell to others (exclusive)
- I'll help with transition (30 days support)

**Total Value:** $1M - $2M
**Your Cost:** $500K + success-based royalties

**IT'S A STEAL.**

## üìà 10-YEAR PROJECTIONS (BONUS)

### Conservative Case Extended:

| Year | Total Domains | Revenue | Coinbase | Your Royalty |
|------|---------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| 6 | 600,000 | $30M | $27.75M | $2.25M |
| 7 | 700,000 | $35M | $32.375M | $2.625M |
| 8 | 800,000 | $40M | $37M | $3M |
| 9 | 900,000 | $45M | $41.625M | $3.375M |
| 10 | 1,000,000 | $50M | $46.25M | $3.75M |
| **TOTAL (10yr)** | - | **$260M** | **$240.5M** | **$19.5M** |

**Even at conservative growth:**
- You make $19.5M over 10 years
- They make $240.5M
- Your $500K investment returns 48,000%

---

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

**The math is INSANE for Coinbase:**

- Low upfront cost ($500K)
- Massive revenue potential ($50M-100M/year)
- You only win if they win (aligned)
- They keep 92.5% of everything
- ROI is 10,000% - 50,000%

**The deal is FAIR for you:**

- $500K for 6 months work (fair)
- $4M-20M in royalties (if they succeed)
- No stress of running startup
- Passive income forever
- Clean exit to next project

**IT'S A NO-BRAINER WIN-WIN.**
