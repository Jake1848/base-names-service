Jesse,

I've built and deployed the first .base TLD on Base L2.
It's live on mainnet right now.

→ Contracts: basescan.org/address/0x53F9f3352ea2587734aCA72A5489eB8E7b5444Ca

You have the distribution I'll never have.

OFFER: $500K + 7.5% royalty on registrations

WHAT YOU GET:
• Complete .base TLD ownership
• 6 months time savings vs building in-house
• First-mover advantage (before competitors launch)

to scale. Worth 15 minutes of your time.

### Follow-Up #1 (If No Response After 3 Days):

**Subject:** Re: .base TLD Acquisition - Quick Question

```
Jesse,

Following up on my email about acquiring the .base TLD.

Quick question: Is this something Coinbase would be interested in,
or should I move forward with other buyers?

I have calls scheduled with a16z and Paradigm next week, but wanted
to give you first look since Base is your platform.

Let me know either way - no hard feelings if it's not a fit.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Demo: [link]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (If No Response After 7 Days):

**Subject:** .base TLD - Final Check Before I Move On

```
Jesse,

Last email on this - don't want to spam you.

I'm finalizing a deal with [a16z/Paradigm/other buyer] for the
.base TLD this week. Wanted to confirm you're not interested before
I close with them.

If Coinbase wants .base, this is your last chance for exclusive access.

Otherwise, no worries - I'll make it work with whoever buys it.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 📧 EMAIL #3: BRIAN ARMSTRONG (CEO)

**To:** brian@coinbase.com
**Subject:** Base Ecosystem Opportunity - .base Domains

---

**EMAIL:**

```
Brian,

Quick note on a Base ecosystem opportunity:

I built the first .base domain name system (like ENS, but for Base).
It's live on mainnet and working today.

Every .base domain strengthens your Base brand - it's marketing that
users pay for. And it enables human-readable addresses for your 108M users.

I'm offering it to Coinbase for $500K + revenue share before taking
it to other buyers.

Worth a look? Happy to demo for you or your team.

[Your Name]

Demo: [link]
Contracts: [link]
```

**Note:** Only send this if you don't get response from Jesse/Ventures after 1 week.
Brian is busy - use sparingly.

Base ecosystem.

**To:** ventures@godaddy.com
**Subject:** Domain Tech Acquisition - .base TLD on Base L2

## 📧 EMAIL #7: UNSTOPPABLE DOMAINS

**To:** partnerships@unstoppabledomains.com
**Subject:** Partnership/Acquisition - .base TLD

---

**EMAIL:**

```
Unstoppable Domains team,

I'm the builder of the first .base TLD on Base L2.

Quick context:
• Base = Coinbase's Layer 2 (500K+ daily users)
• .base = First ENS-compatible TLD on Base
• Live on mainnet, working registrations

PROPOSAL:
A) You acquire .base TLD ($200K-300K), OR
B) We partner (I keep ownership, you handle sales/marketing)

WHY THIS MAKES SENSE:
• You're already in Web3 domains
• Base is growing 10x this year
• First-mover advantage
• Complements your .crypto, .nft, etc.

Open to creative deal structures.

Want to discuss?

[Your Name]
```

## 📧 EMAIL #8: ENS DAO

**To:** [ENS governance forum / Discord]
**Subject:** Proposal - ENS Acquires .base TLD

---

**EMAIL/FORUM POST:**

```
ENS Community,

I've deployed an ENS-compatible .base TLD on Base L2.

PROPOSAL: ENS DAO acquires .base to prevent namespace fragmentation

WHY THIS MATTERS:
• .base TLD could fragment ENS namespace
• Better if ENS controls major TLDs (like .eth, .base, .arb, etc.)
• Base has 500K+ daily users (large potential user base)
• Revenue flows to ENS DAO treasury

OFFER:
$150K-300K in ETH from ENS treasury

ALTERNATIVE:
If you don't acquire it, someone else will (Coinbase, a16z, etc.)
and they may not preserve ENS compatibility.

Open to discussion on governance forum.

Technical details:
[BaseScan link]
[GitHub link]

Thoughts?

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Get Their Attention:

1. **Tag them on Twitter** before emailing
   - "Built the first .base TLD @jessepollak @base - demo here [link]"
   - They see it, then email arrives → higher open rate

2. **Find warm intro** via LinkedIn
   - Search your network for Coinbase connections
   - Ask for intro ("Hey can you intro me to Jesse?")
   - Warm intros = 10x better response rate

3. **Post in their communities**
   - Base Discord
   - Farcaster (tag Jesse)
   - Reddit r/BaseChain
   - Build awareness before cold email

4. **Use video in email**
   - Record personal 30-sec Loom intro
   - "Hey Jesse, quick video explaining .base..."
   - Attach to email
   - Higher engagement than text

### Handle Objections:

**"We want to build it ourselves"**
→ "That's 6 months away. I'm selling to someone in 2 weeks. Your choice: own it or compete with it."

**"Price is too high"**
→ "Let me show you the ROI math. You keep 92.5% of $50M revenue = $46M profit for $500K investment."

**"We need to think about it"**
→ "Totally understand. I have other buyers lined up. What's your timeline? I can hold off if you're serious."

**"Can we do equity instead of cash?"**
→ "I'm open to creative structures. Want to discuss on a call?"
