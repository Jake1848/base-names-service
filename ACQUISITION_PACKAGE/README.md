## 💡 HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "We want to build it ourselves"

**Response:**
> "That's 6 months and $300K+ in engineering costs. I'm selling to someone in 2 weeks. Your choice: own it now for $500K, or compete with whoever buys it (possibly a16z or Paradigm) while spending 6 months building the same thing."

### "The price is too high"

**Response:**
> "Let me show you the math. Even at conservative estimates, you make $55M in 5 years while I make $4.5M. That's 11,000% ROI on your $500K. How is that too expensive?"

### "We need more time to evaluate"

**Response:**
> "I understand. I have other buyers lined up for next week. What's your timeline? If you're serious, I can hold the exclusive for [X] more days, but I need commitment."

### "Can we do equity instead of cash?"

**Response:**
> "I'm open to creative structures. What did you have in mind? Keep in mind I'm looking for liquidity, so any equity would need to be paired with significant cash upfront."

### "This could fragment the ENS namespace"

**Response:**
> "Actually, it's ENS-compatible. Think of .base as the natural TLD for Base L2, just like .eth is for Ethereum. Coinbase owning it prevents actual fragmentation from random actors launching competing .base systems."
