# UI/UX and Code Quality Improvements

This document outlines the findings of the UI/UX and code quality review for the Base Names service frontend.



## UI/UX Improvements

1.  **Real-time Search:** The current implementation requires the user to click a "Search" button to check for domain availability. This could be improved by implementing a real-time search that checks for availability as the user types. This would provide a more seamless and responsive user experience.

2.  **Improved Error Handling:** The error handling could be more user-friendly. For example, instead of just displaying a generic "Search failed" message, the application could provide more specific error messages based on the type of error that occurred.

3.  **Loading Skeletons:** The use of loading skeletons is a good practice, but they could be improved to provide a more accurate representation of the content that is being loaded. This would help to reduce the perceived loading time and provide a better user experience.

4.  **Accessibility:** The application could be made more accessible by adding ARIA labels to all interactive elements and ensuring that all content is keyboard-navigable. The `PremiumDomainCard` component already includes some ARIA labels, which is a good start.


## Code Quality Improvements

1.  **Component-Based Architecture:** The `page.tsx` file is very large and contains a lot of logic that could be extracted into smaller, reusable components. This would make the code more modular, easier to maintain, and more testable.

2.  **State Management:** The application uses a combination of `useState` and `useReadContract` for state management. While this works for a small application, it could become difficult to manage as the application grows. Consider using a more robust state management library like Redux or Zustand to manage the application's state.

3.  **Code Duplication:** There is some code duplication in the `PremiumDomainCard` and `DomainSearchSection` components. For example, both components have logic for handling the registration process. This logic could be extracted into a custom hook to reduce code duplication and improve code reuse.

4.  **Magic Strings:** The code uses several "magic strings" for contract addresses and ABIs. These should be replaced with constants to improve code readability and maintainability. The `CONTRACTS` and `ABIS` objects are a good start, but this could be taken further by creating a separate file for all constants.
