   - Replace `src/components/header.tsx` with `src/components/enhanced-header.tsx`
   - Add the new enhanced components to your components directory

3. **Update Imports**:
   - Update any imports that reference the old component names
   - Ensure all new components are properly imported

## Color Scheme Retention

The upgrade maintains your existing color scheme while enhancing it with:
- Gradient overlays using your primary colors
- Enhanced contrast for better accessibility
- Dynamic color transitions
- Theme-aware animations

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimized Animations**: Using `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Debounced Inputs**: Reduced API calls with smart debouncing
- **Efficient Rendering**: Proper use of React hooks and memoization

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Graceful degradation of animations
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Enhanced Components**: Run the development server to see the animations
2. **Deploy to Production**: The enhanced components are production-ready
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use browser dev tools to ensure smooth animations
4. **Gather Feedback**: Test with users to refine the experience

## Conclusion

Your Base Names frontend has been transformed into a cutting-edge web3 experience that rivals the best sites in the ecosystem. The combination of smooth animations, modern design patterns, and enhanced functionality creates an engaging and professional user experience that will help establish Base Names as the premier domain service for Base L2.
