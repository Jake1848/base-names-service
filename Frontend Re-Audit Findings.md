# Frontend Re-Audit Findings

This document outlines the findings of the frontend re-audit of the Base Names project. The audit was conducted by reviewing the latest version of the frontend codebase and comparing it to the recommendations from the million-dollar roadmap.

## Summary of Findings

The frontend has been significantly improved with the implementation of a new UI inspired by the Coinbase design system. The new UI is modern, professional, and provides a much better user experience. However, the implementation is incomplete and lacks several key features.

## Key Improvements

- **New UI**: The new UI is a major improvement over the previous version. It is visually appealing, easy to use, and provides a much better user experience.
- **Coinbase Blue and Shadcn Dark Modes**: The new UI includes both Coinbase Blue and Shadcn Dark modes, which allows users to customize the look and feel of the application.
- **Framer Motion Animations**: The new UI uses Framer Motion to create smooth and engaging animations, which enhances the user experience.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: The new UI includes a comprehensive analytics dashboard that provides key metrics and insights into the performance of the Base Names service.

## Gaps and Missing Features

Despite the improvements, the frontend is still missing several key features that were outlined in the million-dollar roadmap:

- **Working Wallet Integration**: The frontend does not have a working wallet integration, which is essential for a Web3 application.
- **End-to-End Domain Registration**: The frontend does not have a working end-to-end domain registration system. The registration process is mocked and does not interact with the smart contracts.
- **Domain Management Dashboard**: The frontend does not have a domain management dashboard, which is essential for users to manage their domains.
- **Premium Domain Marketplace**: The frontend does not have a premium domain marketplace, which is a key revenue stream for the project.

## Conclusion

The frontend has been significantly improved with the implementation of a new UI. However, the implementation is incomplete and lacks several key features. It is crucial to address these gaps and implement the missing features to create a fully functional and valuable product.
