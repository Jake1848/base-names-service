## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Security:
- ‚úÖ Only YOU can withdraw (you're the owner)
- ‚úÖ Funds are safe in the contract
- ‚úÖ No one else can access them
- ‚úÖ FeeManager provides additional layer of security

### Withdrawal Frequency:
- **Recommended:** Withdraw weekly/monthly
- **Why:** Saves on gas fees
- **Gas Cost:** ~$0.50-$2 per withdrawal

### FeeManager:
The FeeManager is a separate contract that holds your funds. You'll need to:
1. Check what the beneficiary address is in FeeManager
2. That's where funds ultimately go
3. Make sure you control that address

## üîç VERIFY OWNERSHIP

Run this to confirm YOU control everything:

```bash
cd base-name-service-fork
npx hardhat run --network base scripts/check-ownership.js
```

Should show:
- Owner: 0x5a66231663D22d7eEEe6e2A4781050076E8a3876 (YOUR address)
- You can withdraw anytime

## üí° REVENUE ESTIMATES
