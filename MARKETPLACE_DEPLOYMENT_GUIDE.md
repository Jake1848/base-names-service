## üêõ Known Issues to Test For

### Critical Issues

1. **Marketplace Fee Accounting Bug** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Location:** DomainMarketplace.sol line 390-399
   - **Issue:** `withdrawFees()` withdraws entire contract balance, including active auction bids
   - **Risk:** Owner could drain funds that belong to bidders
   - **Status:** üî¥ NOT FIXED YET
   - **Test:** Don't use `withdrawFees()` if there are active auctions

2. **NFT Approval Required**
   - **Issue:** Users must approve marketplace before listing
   - **UX:** May confuse users (requires 2 transactions)
   - **Solution:** Add clear approval step in UI

3. **Price Display**
   - **Issue:** Ensure prices show in ETH, not Wei
   - **Test:** Verify 0.1 ETH displays as "0.1 ETH", not "100000000000000000"

## üîç How to Debug Issues

### Check Contract on BaseScan

**DomainMarketplace:**
https://basescan.org/address/0x35FF50Fd54e7de7CBc5722C9d380966db049e573

**Read Contract Functions:**
- `getListing(tokenId)` - Check if domain is listed
- `isListed(tokenId)` - Returns true/false
- `marketplaceFee()` - Should return 250 (2.5%)

**Events to Monitor:**
- `Listed` - When domain listed
- `Sold` - When domain sold
- `ListingCancelled` - When listing cancelled

### Common Transaction Failures

|-------|-------|----------|
| "Not domain owner" | User doesn't own NFT | Register domain first |
| "Already listed" | Domain already on marketplace | Cancel existing listing |
| "Not listed" | Trying to buy unlisted domain | Verify domain is listed |
| "Insufficient payment" | Not enough ETH sent | Check correct price |
| "Transfer to seller failed" | Seller address issue | Contact support |
