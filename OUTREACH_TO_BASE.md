## Email Template 1: Formal Business Development

**Subject:** Base Names Service - Decentralized Naming System for Base L2

**To:** partnerships@base.org, bizdev@base.org, ecosystem@base.org

**Email Body:**

Dear Base Team,

I'm reaching out regarding **Base Names Service** (basenamesservice.xyz), a decentralized domain naming system built specifically for the Base L2 ecosystem.

### What We've Built

Base Names Service is an ENS-compatible naming protocol that allows Base users to:
- Register human-readable .base domain names
- Replace complex wallet addresses with simple names (e.g., alice.base)
- Build portable on-chain identity across the Base ecosystem
- Enable seamless peer-to-peer transfers using memorable names

### Technical Implementation

Our system includes:
- ‚úÖ Production-ready smart contracts (OpenZeppelin-based, security audited)
- ‚úÖ Full ENS compatibility (registry, resolver, registrar architecture)
- ‚úÖ Modern Next.js 15 frontend with Wagmi v2 and RainbowKit integration
- ‚úÖ Commit-reveal pattern to prevent front-running
- ‚úÖ Domain marketplace with auction and direct sale functionality
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive security documentation and testing

### Recent Achievements

We've recently completed:
- Comprehensive security audit with all critical issues documented and addressed
- Frontend code quality improvements (zero build warnings, proper TypeScript typing)
- SEO optimization and PWA support
- Production-ready deployment configuration

### Why Base Names Matters for the Ecosystem

1. **User Experience**: Simplifies Base onboarding by replacing hex addresses with memorable names
2. **Network Effects**: Becomes more valuable as more dApps integrate domain resolution
3. **Developer Tools**: Provides SDK for easy integration into Base dApps
4. **Identity Layer**: Creates portable reputation and identity for Base users
5. **Revenue Model**: Self-sustaining through registration and renewal fees

### Request for Support

We're seeking:
1. **Technical Guidance**: Architecture review and best practices for Base L2
2. **Security Audit**: Support for professional smart contract audit
3. **Ecosystem Integration**: Featured listing in Base ecosystem directory
4. **Marketing Support**: Co-marketing opportunities and community exposure
5. **Grant Consideration**: Potential funding through Base ecosystem grants

### Next Steps

I'd love to schedule a call to discuss:
- Technical integration with Base infrastructure
- Potential partnership opportunities
- How Base Names can accelerate Base ecosystem adoption
- Timeline for mainnet deployment

**Project Links:**

## DM Template 2: Twitter/X - Value Proposition Focus

**Platform:** Twitter/X

**Message:**

GM Base! ‚òÄÔ∏è

Base needs a native naming service. Here's why:

‚ùå 0x742d35Cc6... is hard to remember
‚úÖ alice.base is easy

I've built Base Names Service:
‚Ä¢ ENS-compatible .base domains
‚Ä¢ Domain marketplace built-in
‚Ä¢ Full SDK for dApp integration
‚Ä¢ Production-ready smart contracts

This could be huge for Base UX and adoption.
