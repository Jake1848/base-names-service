## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Pre-Launch Tasks

### 1. **API Key Rotation** (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Why This Matters:
If any API keys were accidentally committed to git history, they could be compromised. Fresh keys ensure security.

#### Steps to Rotate API Keys:

**A. Generate New Alchemy API Key:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.alchemy.com/
2. Login to your account
3. Click "Create App" or go to existing app
4. Copy the new API key
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   ```

**B. Generate New WalletConnect Project ID:**
1. Go to https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
2. Login to your account
3. Create new project or generate new ID
4. Copy the project ID
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_new_project_id_here
   ```

**C. Get BaseScan API Key (For Contract Verification):**
1. Go to https://basescan.org/myapikey
2. Sign up/login
3. Click "Add" to create new API key
4. Copy the API key
5. Update `.env` in `base-name-service-fork/`:
   ```bash
   BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_key_here
   ```

**D. Invalidate Old Keys:**
1. Go back to Alchemy dashboard
2. Delete or disable old API keys
3. Go to WalletConnect dashboard
4. Delete old project if applicable

**E. Deploy Updated Frontend:**
```bash
cd base-names-frontend
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "üîê Rotate API keys for security"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with new keys.

---

### 2. **Verify Contracts on BaseScan** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### Why This Matters:
Verified contracts build trust and allow users to read the source code directly on BaseScan.

#### Steps:

1. **Set BaseScan API Key** (from step 1C above)

2. **Verify DomainMarketplace:**
   ```bash
   cd base-name-service-fork
   npx hardhat verify --network base 0x96F308aC9AAf5416733dFc92188320D24409D4D1 0x53F9f3352ea2587734aCA72A5489eB8E7b5444Ca
   ```

3. **Verify MultiSigAdmin:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network base 0xB9E9BccF98c799f5901B23FD98744B6E6E8e6dB9 \
     '["0x5a66231663D22d7eEEe6e2A4781050076E8a3876"]' \
     1
   ```

4. **Verify TestMinter:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network base 0x8c8433998F9c980524BC46118c73c6Db63e244F8 0x53F9f3352ea2587734aCA72A5489eB8E7b5444Ca
   ```

5. **Verify Other Contracts** (if you have deployment args):
   - BaseController
   - BaseRegistrar
   - PublicResolver

**Note:** If you get V2 API errors, the contracts are already being verified. Check BaseScan to confirm.

## ‚úÖ Recommended (But Optional) Tasks

### 3. **Final Testing Checklist**

Before contacting Base team, verify:

- [ ] Website loads: https://www.basenameservice.xyz
- [ ] Marketplace page loads without errors
- [ ] demo123test.base shows as listed for 0.001 ETH
- [ ] Wallet connection works
- [ ] Network switching works (Base Mainnet)
- [ ] All links work (BaseScan, Twitter, etc.)

### 4. **Take Screenshots for Pitch**

Capture these for your Base team email:

1. Homepage with search bar
2. Marketplace page showing listed domains
3. Analytics dashboard
4. BaseScan showing verified contracts (if completed)
5. Successful transaction on BaseScan

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If verification fails:
- Check that BASESCAN_API_KEY is set
- Ensure you're using correct constructor arguments
- Try verifying on BaseScan UI manually

### If new keys don't work:
- Check .env.local exists and is not in .gitignore
- Restart Next.js dev server
- Clear browser cache
- Verify keys are correct on provider dashboards

### If website issues:
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Ensure main branch has latest code
- Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
