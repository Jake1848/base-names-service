# Security Re-Audit Findings

This document outlines the findings of the security re-audit of the Base Names smart contracts. The audit was conducted by running the Slither static analysis tool on the latest version of the codebase.

## Summary of Findings

The re-audit reveals that **most of the critical security vulnerabilities identified in the initial audit have not been addressed**. The new Slither report shows a significant number of high and medium severity issues, many of which were also present in the original report. This indicates a lack of progress in implementing the security recommendations from the million-dollar roadmap.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

The following critical vulnerabilities persist in the codebase:

- **Re-entrancy Vulnerabilities**: Multiple contracts, including `BulkRenewal`, `StaticBulkRenewal`, `DomainMarketplace`, and `DomainStaking`, remain vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks. These vulnerabilities could lead to financial losses for users and the project.
- **Arbitrary ETH Send**: The `BulkRenewal` contract still contains a function that sends ETH to an arbitrary user-supplied address, which can be exploited by malicious actors.
- **Uninitialized Local Variables**: Several functions contain uninitialized local variables, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security risks.

## Other Issues

In addition to the critical vulnerabilities, the audit identified several other issues, including:

- **Write-After-Write**: The `HexUtils` contract contains a write-after-write issue, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Unused State Variables**: Several contracts contain unused state variables, which increases the attack surface and makes the code harder to maintain.
- **Unimplemented Functions**: The `DefaultReverseRegistrar` contract does not implement all the functions from its interface, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Naming Convention Violations**: The codebase does not consistently follow Solidity naming conventions, which makes the code harder to read and understand.

## Conclusion

The security posture of the Base Names smart contracts has not significantly improved since the initial audit. The persistence of critical vulnerabilities indicates that the project is not yet ready for a mainnet deployment. It is crucial to address these issues before proceeding with the project.
