# Smart Contract Re-Audit Findings

This document outlines the findings of the smart contract re-audit of the Base Names project. The audit was conducted by reviewing the latest version of the smart contract codebase and comparing it to the recommendations from the million-dollar roadmap.

## Summary of Findings

The smart contract codebase has seen some improvements, but it still falls short of the recommendations from the million-dollar roadmap. The re-audit reveals that some of the critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed, but others remain. The deployment scripts have been improved, but they still lack a comprehensive verification process.

## Security Improvements

The following security improvements have been made:

- **Re-entrancy Guards**: The `StaticBulkRenewal` and `BulkRenewal` contracts now include re-entrancy guards, which helps to mitigate re-entrancy attacks.
- **Access Control**: The new `BaseNamesAccessControl` contract provides a more robust and flexible access control system.

## Remaining Security Vulnerabilities

The following security vulnerabilities remain in the codebase:

- **Re-entrancy Vulnerabilities**: Despite the addition of re-entrancy guards, the `DomainMarketplace` and `DomainStaking` contracts are still vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks. The current implementation of the re-entrancy guards is not sufficient to prevent all possible attack vectors.
- **Arbitrary ETH Send**: The `BulkRenewal` contract still contains a function that sends ETH to an arbitrary user-supplied address, which can be exploited by malicious actors.
- **Uninitialized Local Variables**: Several functions contain uninitialized local variables, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security risks.

## Deployment Readiness

The deployment scripts have been improved, but they still lack a comprehensive verification process. The `deploy-base-final.js` script includes some basic checks, but it does not verify the deployment in a comprehensive manner. It is crucial to add a comprehensive verification process to ensure that the smart contracts are deployed correctly and securely.

## Conclusion

The smart contract codebase has seen some improvements, but it is not yet ready for a mainnet deployment. It is crucial to address the remaining security vulnerabilities and add a comprehensive verification process to the deployment scripts before proceeding with the project.
