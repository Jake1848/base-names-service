# ENS Registry Authorization Fix

## Problem
Domain registration was failing with "execution reverted" error on Base Sepolia testnet. All diagnostic checks showed:
- ✅ Commitment existed and was valid
- ✅ Domain was available
- ✅ Controller was authorized in BaseRegistrar
- ❌ **Transaction still reverted**

## Root Cause
The ETHRegistrarController was not approved as an operator in the ENS Registry. When the controller tried to call `ens.setRecord()` during registration, it was unauthorized.

The issue occurred because:
1. Controller calls `ens.setRecord(namehash, owner, resolver, 0)` during registration
2. ENS Registry's `setRecord()` has `authorised(node)` modifier
3. Modifier checks: `owner == msg.sender || operators[owner][msg.sender]`
4. Controller was not in the `operators` mapping for the BaseRegistrar

## Solution
1. **Added new function to BaseRegistrarImplementation**:
   ```solidity
   function approveOperatorInENS(address operator, bool approved) external onlyOwner {
       ens.setApprovalForAll(operator, approved);
   }
   ```

2. **Deployed new BaseRegistrar contract** with this function:
   - Address: `0xDE42a2c46eBe0878474F1889180589393ed11841`

3. **Deployed new ETHRegistrarController** pointing to new BaseRegistrar:
   - Address: `0xba83A942A7c5a2f5c079279C0C5b9a99cC51DA26`

4. **Called approveOperatorInENS()** to authorize controller:
   ```javascript
   await registrar.approveOperatorInENS(controllerAddress, true);
   ```

5. **Verified approval**:
   ```javascript
   const isApproved = await ens.isApprovedForAll(registrarAddress, controllerAddress);
   // Returns: true ✅
   ```

## Updated Contract Addresses (Base Sepolia)

| Contract | Old Address | New Address |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| BaseRegistrar | 0x69b81319958388b5133DF617Ba542FB6c9e03177 | **0xDE42a2c46eBe0878474F1889180589393ed11841** |
| BaseController | 0xCD24477aFCB5D97B3B794a376d6a1De38e640564 | **0xba83A942A7c5a2f5c079279C0C5b9a99cC51DA26** |

All other contracts remain the same:
- ENSRegistry: 0x9396f642A4bDabE278D51Dad7b277Ba4151bFfAd
- PublicResolver: 0x2927556a0761d6E4A6635CBE9988747625dAe125
- ReverseRegistrar: 0xa1f10499B1D1a1c249443d82aaDA9ff7F3AE99cF
- BasePriceOracle: 0x3B7d21d238D158eA760FFdB8A5B9A1c3091Bd8c5

## Files Changed
- `contracts/ethregistrar/BaseRegistrarImplementation.sol` - Added approveOperatorInENS function
- `scripts/deploy-new-controller.js` - Script to deploy new controller
- `scripts/upgrade-base-registrar.js` - Script to upgrade BaseRegistrar
- `base-names-frontend/src/lib/contracts.ts` - Updated contract addresses

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Go to the frontend
2. Search for an available domain
3. Click "Register"
4. Complete commit transaction and wait 60 seconds
5. Click "Register" again to complete registration
6. Registration should now succeed ✅

## Diagnostic Scripts
Created several diagnostic scripts to debug the issue:
- `scripts/check-ens-setrecord-auth.js` - Check ENS Registry approval
- `scripts/check-specific-commitment.js` - Verify commitment exists
- `scripts/check-available.js` - Check domain availability

These scripts helped identify that ENS Registry approval was the missing piece.
