# 🛡️ Base Name Service - Security Features

## 🔒 Production Security Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security features implemented in the Base Name Service to ensure safe operation on Base mainnet.

## 🚨 Critical Security Features

### 1. Emergency Pause System
- **Contract**: `contracts/security/EmergencyPause.sol`
- **Purpose**: Allows immediate suspension of all critical operations during emergencies
- **Functions**:
  - `emergencyPause()` - Pauses all pausable functions
  - `emergencyUnpause()` - Resumes operations
  - `isPaused()` - Check current pause status

### 2. Reentrancy Protection
- **Implementation**: OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`
- **Protected Functions**:
  - `register()` - All registration methods
  - `renew()` - Domain renewal
  - Fee withdrawal functions

### 3. Access Control
- **Implementation**: OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`
- **Protected Functions**:
  - Emergency pause/unpause
  - Controller management
  - Price oracle updates
  - Fee management

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Contract**: `contracts/security/RegistrationLimiter.sol`
- **Features**:
  - Maximum 10 registrations per address per hour
  - Configurable limits and time windows
  - Prevents bulk domain squatting

### 5. Fee Management
- **Contract**: `contracts/security/FeeManager.sol`
- **Features**:
  - 24-hour timelock for withdrawals
  - Maximum withdrawal limits (100 ETH)
  - Emergency withdrawal (limited to 10 ETH)
  - Multi-signature compatible

## 🔍 Security Measures by Contract

### ETHRegistrarController.sol
- ✅ Emergency pause protection
- ✅ Reentrancy guards on all payable functions
- ✅ Commit-reveal registration (prevents front-running)
- ✅ Proper domain validation (.base instead of .eth)
- ✅ Access control for admin functions

### BaseRegistrarImplementation.sol
- ✅ ERC721 standard compliance
- ✅ Controller authorization system
- ✅ Grace period protection (90 days)
- ✅ Owner-only critical functions

### BasePriceOracle.sol
- ✅ ERC165 interface compliance
- ✅ Tiered pricing prevents spam
- ✅ Immutable pricing logic (no manipulation)

## 🚦 Risk Mitigation

### High Risk - Mitigated
1. **Front-running attacks**: Commit-reveal pattern
2. **Reentrancy attacks**: ReentrancyGuard implementation
3. **Emergency situations**: Pause functionality
4. **Unauthorized access**: Ownable access control

### Medium Risk - Monitored
1. **Domain squatting**: Rate limiting system
2. **Economic attacks**: Tiered pricing structure
3. **Upgrade risks**: Immutable core contracts

### Low Risk - Accepted
1. **Gas price fluctuations**: User responsibility
2. **Network congestion**: Inherent blockchain limitation

## 🔧 Operational Security

### Deployment Security
- ✅ All contracts verified on BaseScan
- ✅ Deployment scripts include verification
- ✅ No hardcoded private keys or secrets
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Event logging for all critical operations
- Failed transaction monitoring
- Unusual activity detection patterns

### Access Management
- Owner key should be multisig wallet
- Separate keys for different operations
- Regular key rotation recommended

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All contracts compiled successfully
- [ ] Emergency pause functionality tested
- [ ] Reentrancy protection verified
- [ ] Access controls validated
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Fee management tested

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Contracts verified on BaseScan
- [ ] Emergency pause tested on testnet
- [ ] Monitoring systems activated
- [ ] Incident response plan prepared
- [ ] Insurance coverage evaluated

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Level 1 - Low Impact
- Monitor and log
- No immediate action required
- Regular review process

### Level 2 - Medium Impact
- Investigate immediately
- Consider temporary restrictions
- Notify stakeholders

### Level 3 - High Impact
- **ACTIVATE EMERGENCY PAUSE**
- Stop all operations immediately
- Investigate and remediate
- Communicate with users

### Level 4 - Critical
- **IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY PAUSE**
- Coordinate with Base team
- External security audit
- Recovery planning

## 📞 Security Contacts

### Emergency Response
- **Primary**: Contract owner address
- **Secondary**: Pause function (immediate)
- **Escalation**: Base security team

### Bug Bounty Program
- Report security issues to: [security@yourproject.com]
- Rewards available for verified vulnerabilities
- Responsible disclosure expected

## 🔒 Best Practices for Users

### Registration Safety
1. **Verify contract addresses** before interacting
2. **Check gas estimates** before transactions
3. **Use hardware wallets** for valuable domains
4. **Monitor expiration dates** regularly

### Domain Management
1. **Set up reverse resolution** for primary domains
2. **Use secure resolvers** only
3. **Keep resolver records updated**
4. **Transfer ownership carefully**
