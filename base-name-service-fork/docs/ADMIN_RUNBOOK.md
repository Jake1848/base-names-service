   # Connect to multisig wallet
   # Call pause() on ETHRegistrarController
   controller.pause()
   ```

2. **Notification**
   - Post on official channels immediately
   - Notify all team members
   - Update status page
   - Prepare incident communication

3. **Assessment**
   - Document the issue
   - Assess impact and scope
   - Determine fix timeline
   - Plan communication strategy

### 1.2 Emergency Unpause

**Prerequisites:**
- Issue has been resolved
- Fix has been verified
- Team consensus achieved
- Communication prepared

**Steps:**

1. **Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify the fix on testnet first
   npm run test
   npm run deploy:testnet
   # Test the fix thoroughly
   ```

2. **Unpause**
   ```bash
   # Call unpause() on ETHRegistrarController
   controller.unpause()
   ```

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor contract activity closely
   - Watch for any abnormal patterns
   - Verify normal operation resumed

## 2. Fee Management Operations

### 2.1 Referrer Fee Updates

**When to Update:**
- Partner agreements change
- Fee optimization needed
- Market conditions change

**Process:**

1. **Preparation**
   ```bash
   # Check current fee
   const currentFee = await controller.referrerFeePercentage()
   console.log(`Current fee: ${currentFee/100}%`)

   # Validate new fee (max 10%)
   const newFee = 750 // 7.5%
   require(newFee <= 1000, "Fee cannot exceed 10%")
   ```

2. **Execution**
   ```bash
   # Via multisig
   await controller.setReferrerFeePercentage(newFee)
   ```

3. **Verification**
   ```bash
   # Confirm change
   const updatedFee = await controller.referrerFeePercentage()
   console.log(`Updated fee: ${updatedFee/100}%`)
   ```

### 2.2 Treasury Withdrawals

**Process Overview:**
1. Request withdrawal (24-hour timelock)
2. Wait for timelock period
3. Execute withdrawal
4. Verify transfer

**Request Withdrawal:**

```bash
# Step 1: Request withdrawal
const amount = ethers.parseEther("100") // 100 ETH
const recipient = "0x..." // Treasury address

const withdrawalId = await feeManager.requestWithdrawal(amount, recipient)
console.log(`Withdrawal requested: ${withdrawalId}`)

# Note the withdrawal ID and timestamp
const withdrawal = await feeManager.pendingWithdrawals(withdrawalId)
console.log(`Execute after: ${new Date(withdrawal.timestamp * 1000 + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)}`)
```

**Execute Withdrawal (after 24 hours):**

```bash
# Step 2: Execute withdrawal (after timelock)
await feeManager.executeWithdrawal(withdrawalId)
console.log("Withdrawal executed successfully")

# Verify transfer
const withdrawal = await feeManager.pendingWithdrawals(withdrawalId)
console.log(`Executed: ${withdrawal.executed}`)
```

**Cancel Withdrawal (if needed):**

```bash
# Cancel pending withdrawal
await feeManager.cancelWithdrawal(withdrawalId)
console.log("Withdrawal cancelled")
```

### 2.3 Emergency Withdrawal

**Use Only For:**
- Critical security incidents
- Immediate fund protection needed
- Limited to 10 ETH maximum

```bash
# Emergency withdrawal (bypasses timelock)
const emergencyAmount = ethers.parseEther("10") // Max 10 ETH
await feeManager.emergencyWithdraw(emergencyAmount)
```

### 2.4 Freeze/Unfreeze Withdrawals

**Freeze Withdrawals:**
```bash
# During incidents
await feeManager.freezeWithdrawals()
console.log("All withdrawals frozen")
```

**Unfreeze Withdrawals:**
```bash
# After incident resolution
await feeManager.unfreezeWithdrawals()
console.log("Withdrawals unfrozen")
```

## 3. Registration Limiter Operations

### 3.1 Update Rate Limits

**Typical Scenarios:**
- Spam attack prevention
- Network congestion management
- Special events or campaigns

```bash
# Check current limits
const currentMax = await registrationLimiter.maxRegistrationsPerWindow()
const currentWindow = await registrationLimiter.timeWindow()
console.log(`Current: ${currentMax} registrations per ${currentWindow}s`)

# Update limits
const newMax = 5 // New limit
const newWindow = 3600 // 1 hour
await registrationLimiter.setMaxRegistrations(newMax)
await registrationLimiter.setTimeWindow(newWindow)
```

### 3.2 Monitor Registration Patterns

```bash
# Check current registrations for an address
const address = "0x..."
const current = await registrationLimiter.getCurrentRegistrations(address)
console.log(`Current registrations: ${current}`)

# Check if address can register
const canRegister = await registrationLimiter.canRegister(address)
console.log(`Can register: ${canRegister}`)
```

## 4. Ownership Management

### 4.1 Transfer Ownership to Multisig

**Critical Operation - Production Deployment Only**

```bash
# Verify multisig address
const multisigAddress = "0x..." // Gnosis Safe address
console.log(`Transferring to: ${multisigAddress}`)

# Transfer ownership for all contracts
await ensRegistry.transferOwnership(multisigAddress)
await baseRegistrar.transferOwnership(multisigAddress)
await controller.transferOwnership(multisigAddress)
await registrationLimiter.transferOwnership(multisigAddress)
await feeManager.transferOwnership(multisigAddress)

# IMPORTANT: Multisig must accept ownership
console.log("Ownership transferred - multisig must accept!")
```

### 4.2 Verify Ownership

```bash
# Check ownership of all contracts
const contracts = [ensRegistry, baseRegistrar, controller, registrationLimiter, feeManager]
for (const contract of contracts) {
    const owner = await contract.owner()
    console.log(`${contract.address} owner: ${owner}`)
}
```

## 5. Monitoring and Alerts

### 5.1 Key Metrics to Monitor

**Registration Activity:**
- Registration rate (per hour/day)
- Failed registrations
- Rate limiting triggers
- Unusual registration patterns

**Financial Metrics:**
- Contract balances
- Fee collection rates
- Pending withdrawals
- Emergency withdrawal usage

**Security Metrics:**
- Pause/unpause events
- Ownership changes
- Failed transactions
- Unusual admin activity

### 5.2 Alert Thresholds

```bash
# Registration rate alerts
if (registrationsPerHour > 1000) alert("High registration rate")
if (failedRegistrations > 100) alert("High failure rate")

# Financial alerts
if (contractBalance > 1000 ether) alert("High contract balance")
if (pendingWithdrawals.length > 5) alert("Many pending withdrawals")

# Security alerts
if (pauseEvents > 0) alert("CRITICAL: Contract paused")
if (ownershipChanges > 0) alert("CRITICAL: Ownership changed")
```
