## The Jesse Strategy

**The key to everything is Jesse Pollak.**

If he tweets about it = instant legitimacy
If he doesn't = harder path but still viable

Focus 50% of energy on getting his attention.
The other 50% on building community momentum.

**Remember**: He wants Base to succeed. You're helping him.

Position as: "I'm building this critical infrastructure for Base. Want to make sure you're involved from Day 1."

Not as: "Please help me with my project."

## Final Outreach Wisdom

1. **Be persistent but respectful**
2. **Lead with value, not asks**
3. **Show traction, not just ideas**
4. **Create FOMO with timeline**
5. **Build in public for pressure**

The difference between success and failure might be a single tweet from Jesse.

Make it happen. üöÄ
