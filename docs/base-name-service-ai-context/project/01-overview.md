# Project Overview - Base Name Service

## Executive Summary

Base Name Service is a domain naming system for Base L2, similar to ENS on Ethereum mainnet. Users can register .base domains (like alice.base) that resolve to wallet addresses, enabling human-readable addresses for the Base ecosystem.

## The Problem

- Base is the ONLY major L2 without a native naming service
- Users must use long hexadecimal addresses (0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb4)
- No identity layer for Base's 10M+ potential users via Coinbase
- Competitors like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon all have naming solutions

## The Solution

Fork ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and adapt it for Base L2:
- .base TLD instead of .eth
- Optimized pricing for L2 economics
- Direct integration potential with Coinbase Wallet
- ERC-721 NFT domains for true ownership

## Why Now?

1. **Perfect Timing**: Base launched recently, no incumbent
2. **Coinbase Distribution**: Instant access to millions of users
3. **L2 Summer**: Massive growth in L2 adoption
4. **Technical Maturity**: ENS proven model to fork
5. **Base Team Support**: Jesse Pollak actively seeking builders

## Project Scope

### Core Features (MVP)
- Register .base domains
- Resolve domains to addresses
- Transfer/trade domains as NFTs
- Renew domain registration
- Basic resolver for address mapping

### Advanced Features (Phase 2)
- Subdomains (you.company.base)
- Multi-chain address resolution
- IPFS website hosting
- Text records (email, twitter, etc)
- Reverse resolution (address → name)

## Technical Approach

### Option 1: Simple Implementation
- Basic contracts inspired by ENS
- Quick to deploy but needs full audit
- ~$75k development cost

### Option 2: ENS Fork (Recommended)
- Fork actual ENS contracts
- Minimal modifications (ETH → BASE)
- Inherits ENS security and audits
- Compatible with ENS tooling

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Registration Fees**: $10-1000/year based on character length
2. **Premium Auctions**: Single letters, dictionary words
3. **Renewal Fees**: Recurring revenue after year 1
4. **Subdomain Market**: Transaction fees on subdomain sales
5. **Enterprise Packages**: Bulk registrations for companies

### Pricing Strategy
- 3 characters: 0.5 ETH/year (~$1000)
- 4 characters: 0.05 ETH/year (~$100)
- 5+ characters: 0.005 ETH/year (~$10)

## Market Opportunity

### Addressable Market
- **Primary**: 10M+ Coinbase users
- **Secondary**: All Base L2 users
- **Tertiary**: Cross-chain users wanting Base presence

### Revenue Projections
- Year 1: $3-5M (conservative)
- Year 1: $10M+ (aggressive)
- Year 2: $15-20M with renewals
- Exit Value: $50-100M to Coinbase

## Competition Analysis

### Direct Competitors
- None currently on Base (first mover opportunity)

### Indirect Competitors
- ENS on Ethereum (different chain)
- Unstoppable Domains (multi-chain but not Base-specific)
- Other L2 naming services (different L2s)

### Competitive Advantages
1. First mover on Base
2. Potential Coinbase integration
3. ENS-compatible architecture
4. Base team endorsement (if secured)
5. Reserved domains for key players

## Team Requirements

### Immediate (Solo founder possible)
- Smart contract developer (or AI-assisted)
- Basic frontend skills
- Marketing/community building

### Growth Phase (Month 2+)
- 2 Solidity developers
- 1 BD/Partnerships lead
- 1 Marketing/Community manager
- 1 Product designer

## Key Risks

### Technical Risks
- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Front-running attacks (mitigated by commit-reveal)
- Gas price spikes on Base

### Business Risks
- Base team opposition
- Coinbase builds their own
- Another team launches first
- Low adoption

### Mitigation Strategies
- Launch fast (first mover)
- Get Base team blessing early
- Audit contracts before large scale
- Build community support

## Success Metrics

### Week 1
- 100+ domains registered
- 5+ projects integrated
- Base team acknowledgment

### Month 1
- 1,000+ domains registered
- $50k+ revenue
- Coinbase Wallet integration started

### Year 1
- 10,000+ domains registered
- $3M+ revenue
- Acquisition discussions

## Go-To-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Stealth Launch (Week 1)
- Deploy contracts
- Register strategic domains
- Reach out to Jesse Pollak
- Build initial community

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Week 2)
- Premium domain auctions
- Press release
- Base ecosystem integration
- Influencer partnerships

### Phase 3: Scale (Month 1+)
- Coinbase Wallet integration
- Enterprise sales
- Marketing campaigns
- Expand to other L2s

## Investment Requirements

### Bootstrap Scenario
- $75k initial capital
- Break even month 2-3
- Profitable month 3+

### Funded Scenario
- $100k Base ecosystem grant
- $500k angel round
- $2-5M Series A (month 6)

## Exit Strategy

### Primary: Acquisition by Coinbase
- Timeline: 12-18 months
- Valuation: $50-100M
- Strategic fit: Infrastructure for Base

### Secondary: Stand-alone protocol
- Build DAO governance
- Token launch
- Decentralize ownership

### Tertiary: Acquire competitors
- Roll up other L2 naming services
- Become "Universal Name Service"
- Larger exit to infrastructure player

## Call to Action

The window of opportunity is 1-3 months maximum. First mover wins everything in naming services. With ENS code ready to fork and Base needing this infrastructure, execution speed is the only variable.

**Next Steps**:
1. Deploy to testnet TODAY
2. Message Jesse Pollak TODAY
3. Launch mainnet THIS WEEK
4. Start auctions IMMEDIATELY

Time is the enemy. Speed is the strategy.
